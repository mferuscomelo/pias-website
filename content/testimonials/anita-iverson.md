testimonial: "I bought many handmade cards from Pia. They are so exquisite that when I give them as thank you cards or for special occasions like birthdays, I find myself not wanting to part with them. I have also purchased other art from Pia: small and big paintings, magnets etc.: colors pop out and the delicate precise lines with fine detail delight me everyday. Pia is a budding artist and I can't wait to see what else she produces. Whatever it is, I will be first in line for the new art."
