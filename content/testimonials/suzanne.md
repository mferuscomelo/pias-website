testimonial: "Pia is a wonderful young artist who has experimented with many mediums.  I especially loved her ability to offer existing pieces as well as customized options in small canvas-magnet forms; beautiful cardstock with envelopes; or canvases of various sizes for my walls. I highly recommend both supporting this young artist and getting some beautiful pieces to brighten up your living or work areas."
